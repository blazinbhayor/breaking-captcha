# Breaking CAPTCHA Project
## Deakin University Capstone, Trimester 2, 2022

Project lead: Cecilia Sammut (ccsammut@deakin.edu.au)

## Project Description

The goal of the Breaking CAPTCHA project is to develop machine learning, AI, and computer vision models to autonomously solve CAPTCHA problems. The final product of the project will be to provide end users with an interface to solve these CAPTCHA problems. This user interface will be the focus of future iterations.

Deliverables:

-	Infrastructure as code product to enable efficient handover of cloud infrastructure.
-	Machine learning model that will break Audio CAPTCHAs.
-	Progressing the development of a nonsegmentation and OCR model that will break text CAPTCHAs.
-	A coherent repository that will transcend trimesters.
-	A showcase website where our products can be described and promoted for consumers.

### History

T2 2022 is the second implementation of the Braking CAPTCHA project in Deakin University's Capstone program. In the inaugral implementation the focus of the project was on building models to improve on current installations. The collection of work that was produced in T1 2022 can be found in the [Project History folder](https://github.com/cyber-panther/breaking-captcha/tree/main/Project_History/Trimester01.

This trimester the focus on model building remains, however we have an additional focus of building infrastrucure and knowledge management solutions that will transcend trimesters and improve the continuity of the Breaking CAPTCHA project in trimesters to come. This is to support the ultimate outcome of developing an interface to solve CAPTCHA's.

## Operating GitHub (Pull requests)

### Why GitHub?

GitHub is a version control system that allows for collaboration amongst team members working on a project. It is also publishing a platform that allows all members to view the changes that have been made to strcture of the project or the code. It enables us to keep track of the codebase, save our projects as it develop and revisit prior points of the project should it be required.

### Collaborating Through GitHub

You can use GitHub either via its web version or desktop application. Branches are the central operating mechanism GitHub uses for collaboration. It allows us to have different versions of a repository simultaneously without making any change to the main source of code. The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it, allowing for experimentation with the code.

### Pull requests

On the web version of GitHub, you simply have to select the branch you want to work on, be in the 'main' or other branches after which, you will select the edit icon. After adding or making any changes to the code or documentation, scroll down to bottom and select 'Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request'. Rename the branch any way you'd like and click on 'propose changes'. The following page provides you with an option to 'leave a comment' and you should comment on the exact nature of your changes. This will help other members understand your changes more efficiently. Once done, click 'Create pull request'. It then brings you to a page where you 'push' your changes to the selected branch. Again, it provides you with an option to 'leave a comment' and once you have explained the changes made, select 'Merge pull request' and then select 'Confirm merge'. This step will merge all the changes with the main branch that was selected. Finally, select 'delete branch', which deletes the branch that was copied and you were working on prior to the merge. Go back to the main page to view your changes.

### GitHub Admin

You can contact the Agrim Gautum (s221071682@deakin.edu.au) OR Cecilia Sammut (ccsammut@deakin.edu.au) for help with this repo.

This documentation will be updated constantly so keep an eye out!!
